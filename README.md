### Hi there 👋

I am a self-taught front-end developer looking for an opportunity to join a company that is working with the latest technologies. I am coming from a retail background and have been coding on and off for 2 years. My coding journey started with making a website with Wordpress and once I got hooked I put in the work and learned **HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT**. From that point I started learning more about how to make web applications instead of simple landing pages and worked with **React, NextJs, NodeJs, Express** and tried many more technologies.
